		 Dubai is the largest and most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).On the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf, it is the capital of the Emirate of Dubai, 
		 one of the seven emirates that make up the country.Dubai is a global city and business hub of the Middle East.
		 It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo.Oil revenue helped accelerate the early development of the city, 
		 but its reserves are limited and production levels are low: today, less than 5% of the emirate's revenue comes from oil.Dubai's economy now relies on revenues from tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.
         Dubai has attracted world attention through large construction projects and sports events, in particular the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. 
		 Companies in Dubai have in the past been criticised for human rights violations against labourers.

    <h2>Dubai Marina</h2>
    <p class="comment">Dubai Marina is a district in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Dubai Marina is an artificial canal city, built along a two-mile (3 km) stretch of Persian Gulf shoreline. When the entire development is complete, it will accommodate more than 120,000 people in residential towers and villas.[1] It is located on Interchange 5 between Jebel Ali Port and the area which hosts Dubai Internet City, Dubai Media City, and the American University in Dubai. The first phase of this project has been completed. Dubai Marina was inspired by the Concord Pacific Place development along False Creek in Vancouver, BC, Canada.</p>

    <h2>Palm Islands</h2>
     <p class="comment" >Palm Islands are three artificial islands, Palm Jumeirah, Deira Island and Palm Jebel Ali, on the coast of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Creation of the islands started in 2001. As of November 2011, only Palm Jumeirah has been completed. This island takes the form of a palm tree, topped by a crescent.

After completion, Palm Jebel Ali will take a similar shape. Like Palm Jumeirah, each island will be host to a large number of residential, leisure and entertainment centers and will add a total of 520 kilometers of non-public beaches to the city of Dubai.</p>
